You may use parts of the code in your own programs for non-commercial use

I have decided to release this program as *CardWare*. I don't remember
who coined that term, but its meaning is simple:

  If you like the program, send me a postcard. Picture postcards from
  the area where you live are preferred. On the card you may write
  anything you like, e. g. how much you like the program, what a great
  person I am, or whatever comes to your mind. Be creative! :-)
  Electronic postcards don't count.
